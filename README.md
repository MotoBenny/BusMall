# BusMall

CF201 Lab 11

This BusMall application allows a user to vote upon a series of images for which products they are most interested in. After completion of voting (a set number value variable within app.js), The voting data is displayed in a chart utilizing chart.js.

The logic is such that no two rounds of voting will show the same image.

The chat will detail how many times each object was shown, an how many times thai object received votes. The application also stores these votes in local storage, and the chart will display persistent vote data for the products.
